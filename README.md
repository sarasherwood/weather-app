# Weather Forecast App
An app providing accurate, up to date 5 day weather report for the NYC area.   
## About the App
This app was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To obtain the weather forecast, I chose "simpleweather.js", which is a jQuery plugin that relies on Yahoo's API. In addition, I used Boostrap to implement a mobile friendly, responsive grid system. 
## Installation 
There are no necessary dependencies or downloads to use this app. Simply download the source code and open up the "index.html" file in your browser of choice.
